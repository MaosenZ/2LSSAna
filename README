This package was created to analyze hh->4W, based on ROOT5. The logic is to read in ntuples dumped from ttHML group ntuples and perform later study. The core parts are SampleHandler and miniNtuple. 

The input for SampleHandler is ntuples and 
1) build kinematics and make hists;
2) prepare fake factor calculation;
3) make miniNtuples.

The input for miniNtuple is miniNtuples made above and
1) do uncertainties estimations

To run:
make whateveryouwant
./bin/whateveryouwant
For instance, to calculate fake factors and fakes:
1) first select tight+tight and tight+anti-tight events and store in hists for each sample
./bin/runFFcalculator samp FFcal_*jets (notice two jet divisions, so you have to do twice)
2) calculate fake factors
The above step should make hists in temp/ 
root -l src/FFcalculator_electron.cxx
root -l src/FFcalculator_muon.cxx
(always check these two macros and make sure you're reading the right hists)
The output fake factors are stored in output/ff_*jets.txt 
3) read fake factors and apply them to tight+anti-tight events
./bin/runFFApp samp FFApp_*jets
then make fakes
root -l src/FFApp'(0)'  (check the macro make sure you're on the right njet division)
finally make data/mc plots with fakes
root -l src/DataMC.cxx 

Besides, there are many standalone macros in src/ which are for signal optimizations, plots and so on.

Free free to modify the code, but remember keep logging.
